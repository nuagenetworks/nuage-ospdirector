# Requirements:

Required packages are `libguestfs-tools` and `python-yaml`

```
yum install libguestfs-tools python-yaml -y
```


# Steps:

Copy the stopgap-script folder from undercloud-director path /home/stack/nuage-ospdirector-osp-13.<release>/image-patching/ onto the hypervisor machine that is accessible to the nuage-rpms repo.

```
cd stopgap-script/
```

Copy the `overcloud-full.qcow2` from undercloud-director /home/stack/images/ to this location and make a backup of overcloud-full.qcow2

    cp overcloud-full.qcow2 overcloud-full-bk.qcow2


This script takes in `nuage_patching_config.yaml` as input parameters:  Please configure the following parameters.

  * ImageName(required) is the name of the qcow2 image (for example, overcloud-full.qcow2)
  * NuageMajorVersion(required) is the Nuage Major Version and valid options are either '5.0' or '6.0'. Please enter '6.0'
  * DeploymentType(required) is for user to specify which deployment is it. Please choose from "vrs" or "avrs"
  * RhelUserName(optional) is the user name for the RedHat Enterprise Linux subscription.
  * RhelPassword(optional) is the password for the RedHat Enterprise Linux subscription
  * RhelPool(optional) is the RedHat Enterprise Linux pool to which the base packages are subscribed. instructions to get this can be found [here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html/director_installation_and_usage/installing-the-undercloud#registering-and-updating-your-undercloud) in the 2nd point.
  * RpmPublicKey(optional) is where you pass all the file path of the GPG key that you wish to add to your overcloud images before deploying the following packages.

        Note:
            Any Nuage package signing keys are delivered with other Nuage artifacts.  See "nuage-package-signing-keys-*.tar.gz".
            Make sure to copy GPG-Key file(s) to the same folder as "nuage_overcloud_full_patch.py" patching script directory.
  * RepoFile(required) is the name of the repository hosting the RPMs required for patching.

        Note:
           Make sure to place repo file in the same folder as "nuage_overcloud_full_patch.py" patching script directory.

    **we are providing RepoFile exmaple `nuage_6.0_ospd13.repo.sample`**

    **RepoFile can contain only single Nuage repo with required Nuage packages and can also have extra repos with non Nuage packages:**

        [nuage] repo should have following Nuage packages
            nuage-puppet-modules
            python-openvswitch-nuage
            selinux-policy-nuage

###### 3.OVRS Deployment

3.1 Using nuage repo for nuage packages and No Redhat Subscription for dependent packages:

    a. I have configured different repos like following in my nuage_6.0_ospd13.repo:

        [nuage]
        name=nuage_osp13_6.0_nuage
        baseurl=http://1.2.3.4/nuage_osp13_6.0.3/nuage_repo
        enabled=1
        gpgcheck=1

        [extra]
        name=satellite
        baseurl=http://1.2.3.4/extra_repo
        enabled=1
        gpgcheck=1

    b. Configure nuage_patching_config.yaml like:

        ImageName: "overcloud-full.qcow2"
        NuageMajorVersion: "6.0"
        DeploymentType: ["ovrs"]
        RpmPublicKey: ['RPM-GPG-Nuage-key', 'RPM-GPG-SOMEOTHER-key']
        RepoFile: './nuage_ospd13.repo'
        logFileName: "nuage_image_patching.log"

    c. Run: python nuage_overcloud_full_patch.py --nuage-config nuage_patching_config.yaml

3.2 Using nuage packages and with Redhat Subscription for dependent packages:

    a. I have configured single repo like following in my nuage_ospd13.repo:

        [nuage]
        name=nuage_osp13_6.0_nuage
        baseurl=http://1.2.3.4/nuage_osp13_6.0.3/nuage_repo
        enabled=1
        gpgcheck=1

    b. Configure nuage_patching_config.yaml like:

        ImageName: "overcloud-full.qcow2"
        NuageMajorVersion: "6.0"
        DeploymentType: ["ovrs"]
        RhelUserName: 'abc'
        RhelPassword: '***'
        RhelPool: '1234567890123445'
        RpmPublicKey: ['RPM-GPG-Nuage-key', 'RPM-GPG-SOMEOTHER-key']
        RepoFile: './nuage_ospd13.repo'
        logFileName: "nuage_image_patching.log"

    c. Run: python nuage_overcloud_full_patch.py --nuage-config nuage_patching_config.yaml


If image patching fails for some reason then remove the partially patched overcloud-full.qcow2 and create a copy of it from backup image before retrying image patching again.

    rm overcloud-full.qcow2
    cp overcloud-full-bk.qcow2 overcloud-full.qcow2


In order to verify that  machine-id is clear in the overcloud image, run the following command and you should see empty output:

        guestfish -a overcloud-full.qcow2 run : mount /dev/sda / : cat /etc/machine-id

Now you can copy back the patched image to /home/stack/images/ on undercloud-director


Run the below commands:

```
[stack@director ~]$ source ~/stackrc
(undercloud) [stack@director ~]$ openstack image list
```

1. If above command returns null, run the below command
` (undercloud) [stack@director images]$ openstack overcloud image upload --image-path /home/stack/images/`

2. If it returns something like below
```
+--------------------------------------+------------------------+
| ID                                   | Name                   |
+--------------------------------------+------------------------+
| 765a46af-4417-4592-91e5-a300ead3faf6 | bm-deploy-ramdisk      |
| 09b40e3d-0382-4925-a356-3a4b4f36b514 | bm-deploy-kernel       |
| ef793cd0-e65c-456a-a675-63cd57610bd5 | overcloud-full         |
| 9a51a6cb-4670-40de-b64b-b70f4dd44152 | overcloud-full-initrd  |
| 4f7e33f4-d617-47c1-b36f-cbe90f132e5d | overcloud-full-vmlinuz |
+--------------------------------------+------------------------+
```

then run the below command

```
(undercloud) [stack@director images]$ openstack overcloud image upload --update-existing --image-path /home/stack/images/
(undercloud) [stack@director images]$ openstack overcloud node configure $(openstack baremetal node list -c UUID -f value)
```
